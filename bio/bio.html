          Hi there, welcome to my portfolio! So, how does a New York State
          Assembly TV/Video Production Engineer with graphic design experience
          get into web development you ask?? The answer lies in the picture.
          This is only a small fraction of my music collection.
        </p>
        <p>
          A few years ago, I started studying and learning about relational
          databases in order to catalog my collection. I built a database using
          Libre Office Base and learned some SQL, but Libre Base was very slow
          and clunky. So I decided to try to learn how to create my own
          cataloging app and I started to learn HTML, CSS, JS and migrated my
          database over to PostgreSql.
        </p>
        <p>
          On Codecademy.com I have completed a few individual courses and I am
          in progress of their front-end and full stack career paths. I
          understand that learning to code is a long and continuous journey, and
          at this point, I believe I know enough of the fundamentals to be
          helpful to your team. I also believe that if you would help guide and
          aim the direction of my path, I could be an even bigger help to your
          team.
