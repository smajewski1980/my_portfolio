          Hi there, welcome to my bio page! So, how does a New York State
          Assembly TV/Video Production Engineer with graphic design experience
          get into web development you ask?? The answer lies in the picture.
          This is only a fraction of my (at the time of this writing) almost
          16,000 item music collection.
        </p>
        <p>
          I originally started studying and teaching myself about relational
          databases in order to catalog and inventory my collection. I built a
          database using Libre Office Base, but it was clunky and I found
          limitations in designing my forms. For a more personalized approach, I
          decided to learn how to create my own cataloging software. I felt my
          best option was to make something browser based, so I started to learn
          HTML and CSS. I never imagined how much fun it would be!
        </p>
        <p>
          I dabbled with coding a few times over the years, but it never stuck
          like it did this time. After I learned and got comfortable with some
          HTML & CSS, I started learning a little JavaScript too. Then, I
          decided to challenge myself to become a Web Developer. I am currently
          going through the Full Stack Engineer course online through Codecademy
          and only time will tell whether this is just a hobby or if it's time
          for a career change.
